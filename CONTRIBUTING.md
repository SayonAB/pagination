## Issues

When opening issues, try to be as clear as possible when describing the bug or feature request.

## Pull Requests

To hack on pagination:

1. Install as usual (`go get github.com/SayonAB/pagination`)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Ensure everything works, run tests with `go test`
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)

Contribute upstream:

1. Fork pagination on GitHub
2. Add your remote (`git remote add fork git@github.com:myuser/repo.git`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push fork my-new-feature`)
4. Create a new Pull Request on GitHub

Notice: Always use the original import path by installing with `go get`.
